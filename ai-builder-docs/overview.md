# What is AI Builder?

AI Builder is a Microsoft Power Platform capability that provides AI models that are designed to optimize your business processes. AI Builder enables your business to use AI to automate processes and glean insights from your data in [Power Apps](use-in-powerapps-overview.md) and [Power Automate](use-in-flow-overview.md). AI Builder is a turnkey solution that brings the power of AI through a point-and-click experience, so you don't need coding or data science skills to access the power of AI. With AI Builder, you can build custom models tailored to your needs, or choose a prebuilt model that is ready to use for many common business scenarios.

## How can I add intelligence to my business?

Using AI is easy thanks to integration with Power Apps and Power Automate. Adding intelligence to your business is simple:

1. **Choose an AI model type**: Use the model type that suits your business need. Choose from a growing set of AI solutions.
1. **Connect data**: Select your business-specific data from the available options.
1. **Tailor your AI model**: Depending on the type of model, you can tweak custom models to optimize how your AI performs.
1. **Train your AI model**: Training is an automatic process, where AI Builder "teaches" your AI model how to resolve your business problem (for example, how to recognize your products on an image) thanks to your business data and tailoring. When trained, your AI model can generate insights such as the result of a prediction, or the list and number of objects detected in an image.
1. **Use insights from your AI model**: Use the results from your AI model across Microsoft Power Platform to create solutions that meet your business needs, even if you have no coding skills. For example, you can create a flow that automates document processing in Power Automate or an app in Power Apps that predicts whether a supplier will be out of compliance.
