# Overview of AI Builder

AI Builder is a Microsoft Power Platform capability that provides AI models that are designed to optimize your business processes. AI Builder enables your business to use intelligence to automate processes and glean insights from your data in [Power Apps](use-in-powerapps-overview.md) and [Power Automate](use-in-flow-overview.md). With AI Builder, you don't need coding or data science skills to access the power of AI. You can build *custom* models tailored to your needs, or choose a *prebuilt* model that is ready to use for many common business scenarios. 

- Explore AI Builder in [Power Automate](use-in-flow-overview.md).

- Explore AI Builder in [Power Apps](use-in-powerapps-overview.md).

## Add intelligence to your business

Integration with Power Apps and Power Automate makes using AI easy.

To add intelligence to your business:

1. **Choose an AI model type**: Use the model type that suits your business need. Choose from a growing set of AI solutions.

1. **Connect data**: Select your business-specific data from the available options.

1. **Tailor your AI model**: Depending on the type of model, you can tweak custom models to optimize how your AI performs.

1. **Train your AI model**: Training is an automatic process. It teaches your AI model how to resolve your business problem (for example, how to recognize your products on an image) based on your business data and tailoring. When trained, your AI model can generate insights such as the result of a prediction, or the list and number of objects detected in an image.

1. **Use insights from your AI model**: Use the results from your AI model across Power Platform to create solutions that meet your business needs, even if you have no coding skills. For example, you can create a flow that automates document processing in Power Automate or an app in Power Apps that predicts whether a supplier will be out of compliance.
