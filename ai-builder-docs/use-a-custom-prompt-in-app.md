# Use your custom prompt in Power Apps (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A custom prompt in Power Apps empowers makers to incorporate existing prompts into their apps.

Once you've created and tested your prompts using the prompt builder, you can use them within your application by calling them through Power Fx Functions.
Custom prompts can be invoked as Power Fx function calls, this allows you to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into your application.

## Prerequisite

You've created a custom prompt.

## Create an app and configure it

To use a prompt as a Power Fx Function, you simply need to call it by its name, and pass any required arguments. The function will then return the response generated by the prompt, which can be used within your application as needed. This straightforward approach allows you to leverage the power of AI without needing to write complex code.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).
1. Select **+Create** > **Blank app** > **Create**.
1. In the **App name** field, enter **Task ID**.
1. Under the **Format** heading, select **Phone**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. On the left pane, select **Data** > **+Add Data** > *your custom prompt*.

    The following example shows the custom prompt, **Task identifier**.
