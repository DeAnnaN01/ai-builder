# Training errors and issues

AI Builder reports error and issue messages on the model details page. These messages are explained here.

## Errors

When an error occurs, you can't continue until you resolve this error. Here are some error messages that might occur:

- *The model needs at least **\<ThresholdValue>** records to train. **\<EntityName>** has only **\<ActualValue>** records. Add data or select another entity.*

    If you only have 50 records or less, you can't train the model. Ideally, you should have at least 1,000 records.

- *The model needs at least **\<ThresholdValue>** historical outcome records of each outcome value to train. Add data or select another entity.

    You need at least 10 records of historical outcome for each class to train the model and predict the outcome.

- *The model requires at least **\<ThresholdValue>** features to train the model. Select the required fields.*

    You don't have any relevant features generated to train the model.

## Issues

These messages don't prevent you from continuing to train and publish your model. Instead they show where issues might be causing your model to under-perform.

- *The model might produce better performance with optimum records of **\<ThresholdValue>** or more to train the model. **\<EntityName>** has <ActualValue> records. Add data for better model performance.*

    You have less than 1,000 records. Ideally, you should provide at least 1,000 records to train the model.

- ***\<EntityName>.\<AttributeName>** might get dropped from training as it has a single value and does not contribute to training the model.*

    Data fields that have less relevance to train the model are dropped in model training. For example, data fields that all have the same value in each record.

- ***\<EntityName>.\<AttributeName>** has a high ratio of missing values, greater than *\<ThresholdValue>* percentage and might not contribute to train the model.*

    For best results, populate data for the data fields that have a high rate of missing values.

- ***\<EntityName>.\<AttributeName>** has **\<ThresholdValue>** percent correlation <CorrelationName> with <OutcomeAttributeName> and model might suspect to cause target leak.*

    Data fields that have a high correlation with prediction outcome are dropped in model training.
