# Data preparation

Before you create your prediction model, you'll want to make sure your data is in Microsoft Dataverse and that it's in the correct format.

## Create your custom table

Do you have data that you want to import into Dataverse for training in AI Builder? First, you have to create a table. In this example, we'll provide a solution that has predefined custom tables. To use your own data, [create a custom table](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-create-entity) and use your own table instead of the the example used here.

> [!NOTE]
>For best results, use a dataset that is less than 1.5 GB in size. Otherwise, AI Builder uses only 1.5 GB of your data to train and predict. Since you canâ€™t control which data exceeding the 1.5 GB limit isn't used, you should optimize your data to stay under 1.5 GB.

## Sample dataset for prediction model

1. Download the AI Builder sample dataset package: [AIBPredictionSample_simpledeploy_v4.21.3.zip](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:u:/t/PowerAppsAI/EaBYOtfuvc5OqK4qh1-drvoBD_mCfM4hyLz3zJ0EwDqGjg?e=aI2aue)

1. Ensure the file isn't blocked after download. To do this:
   1. Locate the downloaded zip file, right-click, and select **Properties**.
   1. Place a check in the **Unblock** checkbox and select **Apply**.

   > ![Properties screen](media/prep-block.png "Properties screen")

1. Extract the .zip and look for **PackageDeployer.exe** in the extracted folder.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![The extracted folder file names](media/prep-exe.png "The extracted folder file names")

1. Run **PackageDeployer.exe**. You'll see the following screen:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Package Deployer landing page](media/prep-run-dp.png "Package Deployer landing page")

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Select **Office 365** > **Login**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Login to Package Deployer screen](media/prep-dp-login.png "Login to Package Deployer screen")

1. Enter the credentials that you use to log in to the Power Apps maker portal and then select **Next**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Enter your credentials screen](media/prep-credentials.png "Enter your credentials screen")

1. If the login is successful, you'll see the Welcome screen. Read the message and select **Next**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Install the AI Builder prediction sample dataset screen](media/prep-welcome.png "Install the AI Builder prediction sample dataset screen")

1. In the **Ready to Install** screen, make sure you're installing the solution in the correct environment and then select **Next**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screen showing the solution package to be installed and organization name](media/prep-install.png "Ssreen showing the solution package to be installed and organization name")

1. In the **Reading AIB Prediction Dataset Installer Configuration** screen, read the summary information for the data and solutions being imported and then select **Next**.

   It will take a few minutes to import the data. As each step is completed successfully, you'll see a green circle with a check mark next to the step.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Summary of the AI Builder prediction dataset installer configuration](media/prep-config.png "Summary of the AI Builder prediction dataset installer configuration")

1. In the **Installation Complete** screen, complete the process by selecting **Finish**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Installation complete screen](media/prep-finish.png "Installation complete screen")

## How you can use the solutions you installed

The sample dataset installs two (2) solutions in your environment. It also installs sample data for the included entities:

- **Brazilian Commerce:** Use for predicting multiple outcomes.

- **AI Builder Online Shopper Intention:** Use for binary prediction and numerical prediction
