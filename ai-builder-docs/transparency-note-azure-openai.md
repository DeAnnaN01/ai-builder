# Transparency note for Azure Open AI Service in AI Builder

This transparency note describes the AI impact of AI Builder's Azure OpenAI Service's AI Builder feature.

## What is Azure Open AI Service in AI Builder?

The Azure OpenAI Service's generative text capability in AI Builder offers you a versatile and powerful toolset for building AI applications. It allows you to create applications that summarize documents, draft responses, classify text, translate languages, and more. This capability is backed by the Azure OpenAI Service, which utilizes generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology. These models have been extensively trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to generate text that is like human-written content.

## What are the system’s capabilities?

This AI Builder text generation capability can be used for many tasks that involve creating text from predefined templates in numerous scenarios, or from scratch using a prompt. It can be used in an app or a flow.

The templates are:

- Summarize text
- Respond to a complaint
- Create blog posts
- Extract information from text
- Classify text
- Sentiment analysis of text
- Extract action points from text
- Remined email message about a task
- Fact checking Q&A bot

## What is the system’s intended use?

The Azure OpenAI Service in AI Builder empowers you to build intelligent apps and flows that leverage text generation capabilities. This eliminates the need of model training.

## How was Azure Open AI Service in AI Builder evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

[Provide evidence of system accuracy and performance as well as a description of the extent to which these results are generalizable across use cases that were not part of the evaluation.]

## What are the limitations of Azure Open AI Service in AI Builder? How can users minimize the impact of the Azure Open AI Service in AI Builder limitations when using the system?

[See Impact Assessment. Describe the known limitations of the system including uses for which the system was not designed or evaluated. Discuss steps that the user can take to minimize errors and the impact of trade-offs for the user.]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the system?

[Describe the operational factors and ranges within which the system is expected to perform reliably and safely. List the choices that end users can make (e.g., customization, settings, etc.), with a description of how those choices may impact system behavior in the real world.]
