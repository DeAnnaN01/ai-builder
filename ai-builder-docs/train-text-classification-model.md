# Train your category classification model

Before you can use your category classification model, you must train it to perform the way you want. After you train your model, publish it to make it available to other people.

## Train

You're now ready to run your training. Review your configuration, and then select **Train** to begin training your category classification model. When it's ready, you'll be notified.

To retrain and existing version of the model, choose **Retrain now** from the ellipsis in the model summary performance.

You can also train a new version of your model. Select **Edit Model** to create a new draft of your model that you can configure and train.	

## Troubleshooting tips 

If you have difficulty training your model, try these suggestions:

- Make sure your data meets the guidelines listed in [Before you build a category classification model](before-you-build-text-classification-model.md).

- Learn how you can [improve category classification model performance](improve-text-classification-performance.md).  

Download [sample material](text-classification-sample-data.md) and use it for testing.
