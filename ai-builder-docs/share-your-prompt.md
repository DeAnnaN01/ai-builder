# Share your prompt (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

When you create prompts, they're private. This means they're visible and usable in Power Automate, Power Apps, and Copilot Studio only by the person who created them. This allows you to evaluate and utilize them in apps or workflows to ensure their accuracy before sharing them.

If you want other users of the environment or groups to use your prompt in Power Apps or Power Automate, you need to share it.

## Use the Share action

The Share action is available on both the **My prompts** page in Copilot Studio and in Power Automate. It’s also available for the system administrator in the environment, or for any security role that has share permissions. For instance, sharing a prompt is performed by selecting **Share** for the respective prompt. You can add people as **Users** to your model so they can use your model in apps and flows.

## Understand the Share panel

When you select the **Share** action, a **Share** panel appears. This is where you select Microsoft Dataverse users and teams in your organization and share your prompt with them.

### Prompt list views

The prompts you create and the prompts that are shared with you appear in three different views in Power Automate, Power Apps, and Copilot Studio.

- My prompts
- Shared with me
- All prompts

## FAQ
