# Text generation model overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The text generation model's capability is a powerful tool in AI Builder. It enables you to quickly and easily build AI-powered applications that use text generated from your input, like these tools that:

- Quickly and accurately summarize long documents and extracts key information.
- Help draft responses to user queries.
- Classify text into different categories.
- Translate text from one language to another.

Text generation is powered by Azure OpenAI Service, which is built on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technology. These large language models have been trained on a massive amount of text data. This enables them to generate text that's similar to human written text.

## Explore the model

The text generation model has a prompt engineering interface with sample prompts you can try. You can also create your own prompts to instruct the model.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) or [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

1. On the left navigation panel, select **AI Builder** > **Explore** (Power Automate) or **AI models** > **Build an AI model** (Power Apps).

1. Select **Text** > **Text generation**.
