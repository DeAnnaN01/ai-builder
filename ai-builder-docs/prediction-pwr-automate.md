# Use a prediction model in Power Automate

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
 > To use AI Builder models in Power Automate, you have to create the flow inside a solution. The steps below won't work if you don't follow these instructions first: [Create a flow in a solution](/flow/create-flow-solution).

To use real-time prediction in Power Automate. Follow these steps to build a flow:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).
1. On the **Flows** tab, select **New**, and then select the type. (sample is from "Automated - from blank")
1. Select the trigger you want, and then select **Create**.
1. Configure the trigger and add any additional steps to prep data.

1. Add the "Predict" action. 
1. Complete all fields using your data, or data from previous steps in the flow.
1. Update the record with prediction output.

Congratulations! You've created a flow that uses the real-time prediction feature in AI Builder.
