# Collect images for your machine learning model in Lobe (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Consider image quantity and object balance

You'll want to make sure to upload enough images to train your model accurately. You'll also want to make sure there are enough images to represent each object.
This will increase consistency when training your model.

For helpful tips on choosing enough images so that you represent all your objects, go to [Data quantity and data balance](collect-images.md#data-quantity-and-data-balance).

## Assign categories to images
With Lobe, you'll assign categories, known as *labeling*, to your images to create examples that teach Lobe. These examples are known as a *dataset*. From this dataset, Lobe will learn to predict a label for an image automatically.

To learn more about labels and datasets, go to the [Lobe Help site](https://www.lobe.ai/docs/label/label).
