# Use the predict action in Power Automate

> [!IMPORTANT]
 > To use AI Builder models in Power Automate, you have to create the flow inside a solution. The steps below won't work if you don't follow these instructions first: [Create a flow in a solution](/flow/create-flow-solution).

You can use dedicated actions for each AI Builder model in Power Automate. However, the **Predict** action lets you use many AI Builder model types.

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/), select the **My flows** tab, and then select **New > +Instant-from blank**.
1. Name your flow, select **Manually trigger a flow** under **Choose how to trigger this flow**, and then select **Create**.
1. Select **+ New step**, search for **Predict** in the Search for filters and then select **Predict from AI Builder** or **Predict from Common Data Service**. Both actions offer the same features.

   - Business card reader: BusinessCard model
   - Category classification (prebuilt): CategoryClassification model
   - Entity extraction (prebuilt): EntityExtraction model
