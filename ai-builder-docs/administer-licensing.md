# AI Builder licensing

AI Builder is licensed as an add-on to your Power Apps, Power Automate, or Dynamics 365 license. This means you can start your AI Builder trial after you have a Power Apps, Power Automate, or Dynamics 365 license that allows you to create a Microsoft Power Platform environment.

The AI Builder capacity add-on doesn't exist in the Microsoft 365 business premium license.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You might receive this notification when you sign in: **You’ve consumed all of your AI Builder credits. Contact your administrator to get more capacity**. If you see this message, read this article to learn how to increase capacity and get details and FAQs on licensing.

## Purchase additional AI Builder capacity

Ensure that your environment is properly credited by downloading your [AI Builder Consumption report](administer-consumption-report.md).

If your environment has no more capacity, you need to purchase capacity add-ons. The  AI Builder capacity add-on can be purchased by a billing administrator in Microsoft 365 admin center, or by using your usual channel.

The <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder-calculator/" target="_blank">AI Builder calculator</a> helps estimate the required add-on capacity based on your estimated consumption.

Some Microsoft products like Power Apps per app plan, Power Apps per user plan, and Power Automate per user plan with attended RPA include some AI Builder capacity. Your environment admin can check entitlement in Power Platform admin center in [Capacity add-ons](/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on). When this amount isn't enough, you can complete it with one or several AI Builder capacity add-ons.

To purchase the AI Builder credit add-on in the Microsoft 365 admin center:

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).

    You need to be the billing administrator of your tenant to access this page.

1. In the left pane, select **Billing**.

1. Select **Purchase services**.

## Paid licenses

First, you have to purchase AI Builder capacity add-on for your Power Apps or Power Automate licenses. Then an administrator has to allocate that capacity to any Power Apps environment where you want to use AI Builder.

### Allocate capacity

Once entitled to AI Builder capacity, credits are unallocated and available as a pool on the tenant, which can be used on any environment. The administrator can restrict usage by allocating all credits to specific environments.

For information about how to allocate capacity in Power Platform admin center, go to [Capacity add-ons](/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on). For information on how to allocate credits, go to [Manage capacity](administer.md#manage-capacity).

## Trial licenses

Want to get started using AI Builder? Use premium features for a limited time with a [trial license](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder/), or use preview features without obtaining a license at all.

> [!NOTE]
> You *can't start an AI Builder trial* if you have AI Builder credits already on your tenant by purchasing a capacity add-on or through other products.

### Benefits of a trial license

An [AI Builder trial license](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder/) enables you to use AI Builder features for free during the 30-day trial period.

What you get with an AI Builder trial license:

- Create and use AI models in any environment (trial or production).

- Store your AI model results in Dataverse.

- Use AI model in your apps, flows, and more.

    :::image type="content" source="media/administer-licensing/start-free-trial.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Start free trial.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Your AI Builder trial license is applicable at the user level, not the environment level: you can use your trial license on multiple environments. Another user would have to start their own trial or paid license to use your models in any environment.

### Preview features

AI Builder features that are in preview release status are free to use. You don't need to obtain a license to use AI Builder preview features.

### After the trial expires

Your AI Builder trial license expires after 30 days.

To continue using AI Builder, purchase AI Builder add-on capacity and allocate AI Builder capacity to your environments. You may also be able to extend the trial period. Trials can be extended a limited number of times. Extension can only occur after the trial expires.

To renew your AI Builder trial license, sign in to Power Apps or Power Automate, select **AI Builder** > **Explore**, and then select **Extend trial** in the banner on the top.

### Trial capacity

An AI Builder trial license includes a limited amount of AI Builder capacity. You use this capacity when running or training models.

If you exceed your AI Builder capacity, you’ll receive an over-capacity  notification. These notifications appear as banners in AI Builder pages or when using the model.

The following functions aren't available when you exceed capacity:

- Create a model or a new version of a model
- Run a model within Power Apps or in a Power Automate flow.
  - You can still share your model with another user. They can run it using their own AI Builder capacity. 
- Scheduled model run or retrain
  - Some scenarios allow scheduled run or retrain, which is configured on the model settings panel. These scheduled tasks will fail when you exceed capacity. Therefore, data won’t be refreshed, and the model won’t be retrained.

To continue using AI Builder when you exceed capacity, purchase AI Builder add-on capacity, and allocate it to your environments.

If you extend a trial after expiration, capacity is reset. You can again run and train your models, and create new ones. Scheduled run and retrain instances will resume according to the existing settings.
