# AI Builder licensing in a nutshell

AI Builder is licensed as an add-on to your Power Apps, Power Automate, or Dynamics 365 license. This means you need a Power Apps, Power Automate, or Dynamics 365 license that allows you to create a Microsoft Power Platform environment.

Access to AI Builder features within an environment require AI Builder credits.

AI Builder credits come with some specific user licenses, but mostly from AI Builder Capacity add-on. See [Get entitlement to AI Builder credits](/credit-management.md#get-entitlement-to-ai-builder-credits)

Once acquired, credits can be allocated (aka assigned) to specific environment, or left at tenant level.  See [Make credits available for an environment ](/#Make-credits-available-for-an-environment)

Once an environment has access to credits, AI Builder features are enabled in this environment.

Some AI Builder actions consume credits. see [AI Builder Credit Consumption](/#AI-Builder-Credit-Consumption)

Credit consumption can be monitored. see [Monitor usage](/#monitor-usage)

In an environment, when consumption exceeds available credits, environment is in overage and some features are progressively blocked. Purchase of new credits and/or reassignment need to happen. see [Overage](/#overage)

AI Builder credits can also come from AI Builder trial. In that case, they are linked to the user and don't need to be allocated. see [AI Builder Trial](/#AI-Builder-Trial)
