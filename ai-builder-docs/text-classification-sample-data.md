# Use sample data to do category classification

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Get started exploring AI Builder category classification by using sample data to build and train a category classification model. The sample data we provide uses customer feedback for a hospital. The goal would be to train a model that can predict the category of newly received feedback. This model could help the hospital administrator free up time from categorizing patient feedback, leaving more time to act on it and provide a better experience to patients.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample data is added to your environment automatically if you enable the [Deploy sample apps and data](build-model.md#deploy-sample-apps-and-data) setting when creating your database.

## Set up an environment with data

1. Download [AIBuilder_Lab.zip](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2103171) file, which contains category classification sample data.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The [AIBuilder_Lab.zip](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2103171) also contains sample files for working with other AI Builder model types, in addition to some hands-on-labs that you can use to learn more about AI Builder. More information about the contents of the zip file is available in the [readme.txt](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2108226) file that is contained in the zip file.

2. Import the **AIBuildetTextSample_1_0_0** solution to your Common Data Service environment. More information: [Import, update, and export solutions](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/import-update-export-solutions).
3. Upload data from **sampleData.zip** to the healthcare_feedback entity by following instructions in [Before you build a category classification model](before-you-build-text-classification-model.md).

## Create your model

1. Navigate to the AI Builder build screen, and select **Category classification**.
2. Choose a name, and then create your model.
3. Select **Text:** pick the **healthcare_feedback** entity and the **text** attribute.
4. Select **Tags:** choose the **tags** attribute.
5. Choose **English** as the language for classification.
6. Select **Train** to train your model.
