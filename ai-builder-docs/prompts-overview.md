# Overview of prompts (preview)

This article explains prompt engineering and other key concepts to help you create powerful applications that can generate text from your input. Prompt is a natural language instruction that tells the machine learning model to perform a task. The GPT model uses the prompt to determine the structure and content of the text it needs to generate. Prompt engineering is the process of creating and refining the input that's used to generate text with the GPT text generation capability.

Prompt builder is a prompt engineering tool from AI Builder. This tool lets makers write and test prompts for the text generation model.
