# Activity monitoring (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

As you use your AI models, you might need to access data to monitor the activity or consumption of your AI models.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
>
> - This feature is in process of rolling out, and might not be available in your region yet.

The **AI Builder activity** section of the Power Automate portal (**Monitor > AI Builder activity (preview)**) provides tables and graphs to monitor AI models and the data processed by the AI models, as well as track AI credits consumption.

You can filter the presented data by timeframe or by model. 
Use the "See more" link to display additional data.

## Monitoring data available for makers and admins

The AI Builder activity section is helpful for makers who want to get monitoring on their AI models usage, as well as for environment admins who want to monitor all activity in an environment. The monitoring data is stored in the AI Event table, in your Dataverse.

If you have a _System Administrator_ or a _System Customizer_ role for the current environment, you can see all activity for all AI models.

If you have a _Basic User_ or _Environment Maker_ role, you can only see your own activity, of the AI models you have access to.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - The monitoring data persists in the AI Event Dataverse table even if the model/flow/app are deleted.
> 
> - The AI Event Dataverse table contains input of the AI model predict actions, for text scenarios only.

The data included in the AI Builder activity page is: 

|Column Name|Description|
|--------|--------|
|Data processed|Contains the text input of the AI model predict action for text processing models, or “Image” or “Document” for other models|
|Data type|“Text”, “Jpeg”, “Png”, “Bmp”, “Pdf”, or “Unknown”|
|Date|Processing date|
|Model|The name of the AI model used, “(deleted)” if the model has been deleted|
|Processed by|Name of the person who did the predict (typically the Power Automate flow owner, or the person who executed the Power Apps app)|
|AI Credits|Number of credits consumed for this AI predict action|

## AI Builder activity monitoring Dataverse table with potentially large data volumes

|Display name|System name|Details|
|--------|--------|--------|
|AI Event|Msdyn_aievent|The **AI event** table stores activity data about AI models activity (“predicts”), such as the processed data type, processed data info (for text scenarios), processing date, processing status, and credits consumed.|

As the data is stored in your **AI Event** Dataverse table, you can export it, in a CSV format for example : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-import-export#export-data

## Delete AI Builder activity monitoring data

Effective management of historical data generated by your Power Automate Flows, Power Apps or other Power Platform products can be important to ensure that your Microsoft Dataverse environments remain efficient and cost-effective. By implementing data retention policies and utilizing features like Bulk Record Deletion of Microsoft Dataverse and the Power Platform admin center, you can proactively manage the accumulation of historical data.

In the following section, we'll walk you through the steps on how to purge historical AI Builder activity monitoring data from your environment using Dataverse's built-in bulk-delete feature. This feature allows you to quickly and easily remove large amounts of data from your environment in compliance with your specific data retention policies, ensuring efficient data storage and performance management. In addition to ad-hoc bulk-delete jobs, you could also schedule recurrent bulk-delete jobs that will find and delete records in a table that are, for example, _OlderThanXDays_.

We'll cover how to identify the AI Builder activity monitoring data that could be purged and how to create a bulk delete job to delete the data.

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> Before deleting Dataverse data, it is important to understand that the data is permanently deleted from your environment, and there's no way to recover individual records once they've been deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> To create bulk-delete jobs in Dataverse, you need to have the _Bulk Delete_ privilege in at least one of the roles that have been assigned to you.

### Creating a bulk-delete job to delete AI Builder activity monitoring data

To bulk-delete data in Dataverse, follow the detailed steps below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Before performing any bulk delete operations, it is important to thoroughly test and review your filter results since bulk-delete operations are **irreversible**.

1.	Sign in to the Power Platform admin center.
2.	Select Environments in the left navigation pane, select your environment, and then select Settings on the top menu bar.
3.	Select Data management > Bulk deletion.
4.	From the Bulk Record Deletion grid, select New on the command bar. This will open the Bulk Deletion wizard that allows you to define a query for the records you want deleted.
5.	In the Look for list, select the AI Events table from the list.
6.	In the search criteria area, add desired filter that should return the records that you want to be deleted. Here’s an example that will find all AI Builder models activity that are older than 6 months (format: Field | Filter Type | Value):
Processing date | Older Than X Months | 6
7.	Select Next.
8.	In the Name text box, type a name for the bulk deletion job for example “Bulk-delete of AI models monitoring data older than 6 months”.
9.	Select a date and time for the job start time (preferably a time when users are typically not online).
10.	Select the Run this job after every check box, and then in the days list, select the frequency you want the job to run.
11.	If you want a notification e-mail sent, select the Send an email to me (email@domain.com) when this job is finished check box.
12.	Select Next, review the bulk deletion job, and then select Submit to create the recurring job.
