# Use the form processing model in Power Automate


 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > To use AI Builder models in Power Automate, you have to create the flow inside a solution. The steps below won't work if you don't follow these instructions first: [Create a flow in a solution](/flow/create-flow-solution).

## Create your flow

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

1. Select **My flows** in the left-side navigation pane, and then select **Create from blank**.

1. Select **+New** > **+Instant-from blank**.

1. Name your flow, select **Manually trigger a flow** under **Choose how to trigger this flow**, and then select **Create**.

1. Expand **Manually trigger a flow**, select **+Add an input**, and then select **File** as the input type.

1. Select **+ New step**. Don't worry about the file information fields at this point - that comes later.

1. Search for **Predict** in the **Search for filters and actions** box, and then select **Predict Common Data Service (current Environment)** in the list of actions.
    >[!NOTE]
    > **Predict Common Data Service (current Environment)** doesn't appear unless you've followed these instructions first: [Create a flow in a solution](/flow/create-flow-solution).

1. Select the form processing model you want to use, and select the **Document type**:

    - For a .jpeg image of the form: image/jpeg
    - For a .png image of the form: image/png
    - For a .pdf document of the form: application/pdf

1. In the **Document** field in the Predict window, select **File Content**:

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select file content](media/flow-select-file-content.png "Select file content")

1. In the successive actions, you can use any fields and tables extracted by the AI Builder model. For example, let's say that our model is trained to extract the *Invoice Id* and the *Total Amount* value, and we want to post those to a Microsoft Teams channel. Just add the **Post a message to Teams** action, and then select your fields in the list of tokens.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    >- To retreive the value for a field, select **<field_name> value** . For example, for the *Invoice Id* field, select **Invoice Id value**.
    >- To retrieve the confidence score for a field, select **<field_name> confidence score** . For example, for the *Invoice Id* field, select **Invoice Id confidence score**.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Form processing flow overview](media/flow-fp-overview.png "Form processing flow overview")

Congratulations! You've created a flow that uses an AI Builder form processing model. Select **Save** in the upper-right corner, and then select **Test** to try out your flow.
