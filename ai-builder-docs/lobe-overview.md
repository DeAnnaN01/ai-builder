# Overview of Lobe image classification (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Image classification is a machine learning approach that categorizes images to represent their content. This can be used to gain insights from large sets of images, or automatically alert you with new incoming videos or images. Image classification is similar to [object detection](object-detection-overview.md) in the AI Builder custom object detection AI model.

With Lobe, you train all your models on your computer. When you train this way, you don't use AI Builder credits. Lobe is integrated with Power Platform, which adds the ability to export your model to AI Builder to use in [canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started) and [Power Automate flows](/power-automate/flow-types).

## Business scenarios

Image classification can help organize, sort, classify, or alert you for issues or important insights. If there are business processes where you're working with cameras or large sets of images, there's an opportunity to automate processes with computer vision.

Some common business scenarios are:

- Analyze defects in manufacturing.

- Monitor cameras.

- Work with online retail images.

- Collect images in the field.
