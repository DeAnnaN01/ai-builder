# Overview of Lobe image classification (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Lobe has everything you need to bring your machine learning ideas to life. Just show it examples of what you want it to learn, and it automatically trains a custom machine learning model that can be shipped in your app.

Lobe is a free, easy to use Desktop app to train machine learning models. All the training happens on your computer, so it doesn't require any AI Builder credits to train models. Lobe is integrated with Power Platform, adding the ability to export your model to AI Builder to use in canvas apps and Power Automate flows.

To learn how to use Lobe, go to [Lobe help](https://www.lobe.ai/docs/welcome/welcome).

## Business use-cases

Image classification can help organize, sort, classify, or alert you for issues or important insights. If there are business processes where you are working with cameras or large sets of images, there is an opportunity to automate processes with computer vision.

Some common business use-cases are:
- Analyze defects in manufacturing

- Monitor cameras

- Work with online retail images

- Collect images in the field.
