# Overview of  image classification by Lobe (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Image classification is a machine learning approach that categorizes images to represent their content. This can help organize, sort, classify, or alert you for issues or important insights. Image classification is similar to to the AI Builder [object detection](object-detection-overview.md) custom object detection model.

With image classification by Lobe, you train all your models on your computer. When you train this way, you don't use AI Builder credits. Lobe is integrated with Power Platform, which adds the ability to export your model to AI Builder to use in [canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started) and [Power Automate flows](/power-automate/flow-types).
