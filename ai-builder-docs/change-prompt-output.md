# Change the output of your prompt

## Benefits
By default, the prompt will generate a text as response. This can be convenient for many uses cases but if the response has several elements that need to be identified individually, the text response can be limited.

The JSON output allows you to generate a JSON structure for your prompt response instead of a text. This allows an easier processing of responses with multiple elements in Power Automate or Power Apps.

Example of use cases that become possible with JSON output
- Display structured content like project schedule or product information.
- Extract data from text like invoices, purchase order, delivery forms and many more.
- Identify object attributes from text sources like emails or Dataverse data.
- Get multiple categories or sentiments from a text.

See [more details](change-prompt-output.md#use-cases) on the uses cases below in this documentation.
