# Use your AI model

After you publish your model, you can use it across Microsoft Power Platform to create end-to-end solutions that meet your business needs.

## Get straight to productivity

When you select a model from **Get straight to productivity**, you can choose  how you want to use the model and then AI Builder will provide you with the steps to build it:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Choose how to use your model.](media/select-productivity.png "Choose how to use your model.")

## Optimize a model for your business outcome

Unlike a prebuilt model, a custom model allows you to customize your own steps. You can see how your model is used in the detail page:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![How your model is used.](media/model-used-box.png "How your model is used.")
