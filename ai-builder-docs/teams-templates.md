# Use AI Builder templates in Teams


You can use Power Automate templates in Teams that solve a specific business purpose using AI Builder actions.

## Discover AI Builder templates in Teams

1. Go to your Teams app or [Teams web](https://teams.microsoft.com)
1. Click on **Apps** icon on the bottom left
1. Look for the app named **Power Automate** and install it. The app appears on the left menu of Teams. You can pin the app to keep it there when you reopen Teams
1. Click on the Power Automate app and go to **Create** tab. From there you can search for the AI Builder templates listed in the next section of this documentation
    
    Add image to illustrate
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Predict action](media/predict-action.png "Predict action")

## Create a flow from a template
From the list of AI Builder templates, pick the one that fits the most to your business case (note that you can edit the template in advanced mode to apply personal changes):

  Add image to illustrate
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Predict action](media/predict-action.png "Predict action")

If you don't have Microsoft Dataverse you will see the following dialog:

When clicking on the **Continue** button, Dataverse will be installed. It usually takes couple of minutes (it some particular cases in cas take more than 1h).

If Dataveserse is already installed, you will land on the simplified template experience for Teams. The first screen asks you to validate connections:

 Add image to illustrate
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Predict action](media/predict-action.png "Predict action")

Note: An AI Builder trial will be started or extended if needed. This action will be performed silentely upon clicking on the **Continue** button.

Once all your connections are valid you can click on **Continue**.

This is now time for you to enter the parameters required by the template to create the flow:

 Add image to illustrate
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Predict action](media/predict-action.png "Predict action")

Note: there it is also possible to click on "Edit in advanced mode". This will open the full flow editor within Teams. 

Once you filled all the parameters, your can click on **Create**. After few seconds, your flow will be created and ready to use.
