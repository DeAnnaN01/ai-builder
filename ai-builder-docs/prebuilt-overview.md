# Overview of prebuilt AI models
<!--SELF. Can the custom AI model overview include a page like this? The "Availability" column seems like it would be useful. Note that this table doesn't include "Category" (which was "Vision" and "Language" in the main overview.) What the heck does "Category" signify?? -->
AI Builder prebuilt models help you add intelligence to apps and flows without having to gather data and then build, train, and publish your own models. For example, you can add a component in Power Apps based on prebuilt model that recognizes contact information from business cards. You can use a prebuilt model in Power Automate to analyze whether customer feedback was positive or negative.

Prebuilt models are available in Power Automate and Power Apps, depending on the model. The following prebuilt models are currently available in AI Builder:
<!--Rearranged to match the order in the TOC, also added "Category classification." -->
