# Use a prebuilt prompt in a Dataverse low-code plug-in

A low-code plug-in can enable advanced business logic without the need to write code. Instead you can use PowerFx, which is an expression language similar to Excel. In the following example, you add a column named **Summary** to the Email table. Then, you create a low-code plug-in that uses the `AISummarize` prebuilt prompt to summarize the email and save the summary into the new **Summary** column.

## Prerequisites

- Verify the [prerequisites](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/dmartens/EXtJKRsC9rJGsFFwllOLTsEBiDgbvu90AoxwT3XOZRJGQA?e=LYA2sz) for using prebuilt prompts.
- Basic understanding of [low-code plug-ins](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/maker/data-platform/low-code-plug-ins).

## Add a new column named 'Summary' to the Email table

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

    If you don't already have a Power Apps account, select the **Get started** free link.

1. Select **Tables** from the left navigation bar.
1. Select the **Email** table, and then select **Edit**.
1. Select **New column**.
1. For the **Display name**, enter **Summary**.
1. For the **Description**, enter **A summary of the email generated by AI.**
1. For **Data type**, select **Text** and then under the **Multiple lines of text** section, select **Plain text**.
1. After verifying the selected options, select **Save**.

1. Select and drag the **Summary** column to add it to the new section on the form.
1. Select the **Summary** column on the form.

1. Select **Save and publish**.

## Create a low-code plug-in

1. Select **Apps** in the left navigation bar of the Power Apps portal.
1. Select **Shared with me.**
1. Select **Dataverse Accelerator App** and then select **Play**.
1. Select **Create automated plug-in**.
1. For the **Display name**, enter **Summarize Email**.
1. For the **Table**, select **Email**.
1. In the **Expression** section, enter the following value:  

    `Set(Summary, AISummarize(Description))`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The formula previously shown uses AI to summarize the email regardless of the length. Alternatively, you can use a condition in the formula to only summarize if the length of the text is over a specified size. In the following example, the text is only summarized if the length of the **Description** field is over 1,000 characters. If it's less than 1,000 characters, the Summary will be updated with the text, **Emails shorter than 1,000 characters are not summarized.**

    If (Len(Description) &gt; 1000, Set(Summary, AISummarize(Description)), Set(Summary, "Emails shorter than 1,000 characters are not summarized."))

1. Select **Save**.

## Test the low-code plug-in

1. Open a [model driven app](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/user/use-model-driven-apps) which includes the Account or Contact table. In the following example, the Sales Hub app will be used but any app where you have access to a table such as Account or Contact which can have activities associated with it will work.
1. Within the model driven app, select **Accounts**.
1. Open an existing account record. Create an Account record if one doesn't exist.
1. Within the Timeline section in the center of the account form, select **+** and then select **Email**.
1. In the Subject column, enter **AI Summarize Demo**.
1. In the email body section, enter the following text:  

    **Dear Customer Support Team,**

    **I hope this email finds you well. My name is Paul Cannon, and I am writing to you regarding my recent order (\#123456) placed on your website. I have been a loyal customer for several years, and this is the first time I have encountered such a significant issue.**

    **Upon receiving my order yesterday, I was dismayed to find that several items were missing from the shipment. I carefully checked the packing slip against the items in the box, and it appears that the following items are missing:**

    **Product A - Quantity: 2<br>
    Product B - Quantity: 1<br>
    Product C - Quantity: 3**

    **I have attached a photo of the packing slip and the contents of the package for your reference. As you can imagine, I am quite disappointed as these items were intended for a special event happening this weekend, and now I am left without crucial components.**

    **To complicate matters, I also noticed that one of the items I did receive, Product D, arrived damaged. The packaging was torn, and upon inspection, the product itself has visible scratches and dents. I have attached images of the damaged item for your review.**

    **I understand that errors can occur in the fulfillment process, but I am hopeful that your team can rectify this situation promptly. As the event is fast approaching, time is of the essence. I kindly request that you:**

      **Ship the missing items (Product A, B, and C) via expedited shipping to ensure they arrive before the weekend. Provide instructions for the return of the damaged item (Product D) and arrange for a replacement to be sent out at your earliest convenience. I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and trust that your team will handle it with the efficiency and professionalism I have come to expect from your company. Please confirm receipt of this email and update me on the status of the resolution process.**

    **Thank you for your understanding and assistance.<br>
    Best regards,<br>
    Paul Cannon**
